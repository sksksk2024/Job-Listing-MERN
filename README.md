# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Iâ€™ve gained a ton of experience over the past few days of hard work. I dove deep into the logic and integration
of MongoDB with the front-end, which was definitely the most challenging part for me. Itâ€™s amazing to realize that
deploying a full-stack app is now second nature to me, thanks to the hands-on experience I gained 
(took me just 20 minutes, instead of 1-2 days, to nail it ðŸ’¥). Feel free to check it out
â€” it's the most complex project I've done so far, and Iâ€™m super proud of how it turned out.ðŸ”¥
